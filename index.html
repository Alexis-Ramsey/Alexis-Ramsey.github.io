            <h1>About Me:</h1>
            <div class="prose">
                <p>It's close to three years since I graduated from high school. At that point of time, I had my mind set on being a vet or some type of nurse. 
                   Yeah, that's a difference between that occupation to now becoming a developer. I can thank life problems to that! After some of things that happened in my life,
                   I been going from job to job trying to find something that interest me and make it my career, but nothing was satisfying me. I, then, decided to go back to college
                   and going back to learn computer programming or any thing of that sort. I registered for the class and got everything ready to start school, then I found out about 
                   <a href="https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=0732f86bec41e20dJmltdHM9MTcwMTY0ODAwMCZpZ3VpZD0wMTAzOGJlNi1jNzIwLTY1MTQtMzU5Yi05ODJjYzYwNTY0YjEmaW5zaWQ9NTIxOQ&ptn=3&ver=2&hsh=3&fclid=01038be6-c720-6514-359b-982cc60564b1&psq=ms+coding+academy&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly9tc2NvZGluZy5vcmcv&ntb=1/">Mississippi Coding Academy.</a>
                   A friend of my family came to us to have lunch, and told me about the programming and said really good things about it.
                </p>

                <p>Now, I've been in this program for 4 months and know the basic of coding in C#, making a WPF app, and little of game coding. I'm learning web designs at the moment. 
                   There's still more knowledge to grab hold of but I'm happy at where I am at this moment. I could never imagine myself 3 years ago saying I wanted to became a developer, and coding
                   in C# or making web pages.
